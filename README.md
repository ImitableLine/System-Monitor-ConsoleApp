# Task-Scheduler-ConsoleApp

This app is made to get me used to tracking system statistics, and also threading.
It's designed to use as a launching point to create a more feature complete UI for it.

## Features
- Cpu usage, idle and interrupts.
- Memory available and committed.
- Bandwith is upload and download speed (Mb.s)

## To use:
Just clone the repo and launch it.
